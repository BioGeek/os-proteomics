# Open source, and FAIR Research Software in Proteomics

## Description 

This repository is an effort from the proteomics community to write a critical view point about Open source (OS) in computational proteomics. We aim the following: 
 - Define the role of OS for the field (computational proteomics) and science in general. 
 - Define open source, the implications for the review process, and how to make clear for users, developers, journal reviewers and community what is open-source, what is not. 
 - We aim to define the role of OS in the development of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) research software in proteomics.
 - We aim to define some important concepts for computational proteomics like distribution, licensing, and citation of software.
 - We also want to explore other omics fields and how they are dealing with OS and FAIR software.

The tentative title of the manuscript is: "Open source, and FAIR Research Software in Proteomics." We plan to write the manuscript as a GitHub project where contributors could do Pull Requests (PR), issues to comment topics, point of views, etc. The manuscript is written in Markdown and converted to LaTeX using `pandoc`.
