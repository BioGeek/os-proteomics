### Title: Open source, and FAIR Research Software in Proteomics

### Introduction

Studies have shown that over 90% of scientists consider software critical to their research, with nearly 70% stating that their work would be infeasible without it [28751965]. Proteomics, like many areas of scientific and omics research, has become increasingly dependent on sophisticated and complex software algorithms and tools for data analysis and interpretation. Algorithms and software tools start from data generation and acquisition of mass spectrometers to data processing, analysis, and interpretation []. 

Computational proteomics, along with algorithm and software development, faces several key challenges common to other omics fields:

- The increasing complexity of data generated by mass spectrometers, the complex sequence of steps from spectral processing to statistical analysis, along with the need to manage algorithmic details and parameter settings, all contribute to making software development in proteomics a complex and demanding endeavor.
- Without structured development practices, proteomics software often struggles to maintain the quality, sustainability, and reproducibility necessary for reliable scientific research.
- Although most software tools are described in publications, the absence of open-source code, comprehensive documentation, and version control often impedes reproducibility and reuse. This lack of accessibility also limits opportunities for computer scientists and developers to contribute effectively to advancing proteomics software.

Open-source software (OSS) offers an answer to these challenges, empowering proteomics with tools that are not only accessible but also foster community-driven development, rigorous validation, and transparent sharing of methodologies [].

OSS has demonstrated clear benefits in increasing the accessibility, reusability, and visibility of scientific software. With code freely available for inspection, modification, and distribution, OSS encourages collaboration and creates avenues for continuous improvement—factors that are critical in fields as data-intensive as proteomics. OSS is also aligned with the FAIR Guiding Principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) established for research data, which were expanded in 2022 to address the growing recognition of research software as a foundational research asset [].

In this viewpoint manuscript, we aim to explore the role of OSS in computational proteomics and its implications for the development of FAIR research software. We will discuss the benefits and challenges of OSS in proteomics, the role of OSS in the development of FAIR research software, and the importance of distribution, licensing, and citation of software in computational proteomics. We will also explore how other omics fields are dealing with OSS and FAIR software, and how these experiences can inform the development of proteomics software.

### What does it mean for software to be "open-source"? 

OSS (open-source software) refers to software where the source code—the core instructions that define how the software functions—is freely accessible to anyone. Unlike "closed-source" software, where the code remains private, OSS provides transparency by design, which is essential for fostering trust, collaboration, and improvement in science. However, the open- or closed-source label simply addresses code visibility; it's the software license that determines who can use, modify, or distribute the software and under what conditions.

"Free and open-source software" (FOSS) is a related term that often causes confusion. Here, "free" doesn’t imply no monetary cost but rather emphasizes freedom: users can run, copy, modify, and distribute the software as they wish (https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html). While we choose to focus on OSS broadly, the licenses discussed below also align with FOSS principles.

Open-source is often misunderstood as merely free (no cost) software or lacking professional quality. OSS does not mean the software is without costs, nor does it imply a lack of security or support. Many open-source projects are maintained by dedicated teams and backed by extensive testing and security protocols. Moreover, open-source doesn't restrict developers from monetizing their work; it simply ensures that the source code remains accessible. Indeed, later we will describe common strategies for commercializing OSS.

### Why Open-Source Software is Essential for Scientific Research

#### Algorithms and models can be scientific output

The scientific community increasingly recognizes that algorithms are no longer just tools in the research toolkit; they can be the focus and outputs of research, meriting the same level of scrutiny, validation, and reproducibility as traditional experimental data. 
Computational models and algorithms often function as both the method and the research focus, designed to test hypotheses and introduce novel approaches. Thus, their implementations and details are essential to justifying scientific claims in publications and evaluating these claims during peer review. In this context, the source code of an algorithm is akin to raw experimental data—like a western blot—providing a basis for other researchers to examine the methods, verify results, and assess the validity of conclusions.

This evolution in the role of algorithms was notably highlighted in 2024 when the Nobel Prizes in Physics and Chemistry were awarded for breakthroughs in computational fields: deep learning and protein structure prediction. These recognitions underscore the transformative impact of computational research in modern science. However, the scientific community risks losing credibility and reproducibility if such groundbreaking computational contributions remain closed-source. Without open-source code, advancements become little more than advertisements of ideas rather than rigorously validated science, as we later discuss.

The 2024 AlphaFold3 controversy exemplifies this issue. Unlike its predecessors, the AlphaFold3 source code was not released with the publications, preventing independent verification or adaptation of their methods. Without the code, scientists cannot fully replicate the work or evaluate its accuracy, limiting the community’s ability to build upon the findings. Publishing an algorithm without releasing the code is like publishing experimental results without providing the underlying data: it fundamentally hinders scientific transparency.

#### Transparency promotes scientific rigor

When algorithms or models are considered primary research outputs, implementing them as OSS becomes essential. Inspection of the code allows the scientific community to apply rigorous standards of replication and validation, building upon the same FAIR concepts that we apply to data.. OSS ensures that researchers have the opportunity to independently verify results, which strengthens the credibility of the findings and increases confidence in computational methods as scientific tools.

Even meticulously documented algorithms can vary significantly in their real-world implementation. Minor differences in programming choices, software dependencies, and hardware environments can alter outcomes in ways that are often invisible in publications. Open-source code documents the detials necessary for researchers to understand precisely how a model or algorithm functions in practice, beyond theoretical descriptions. This level of transparency is vital to scientific integrity; it ensures that others can accurately replicate studies, identify discrepancies, and reveal assumptions that might otherwise go unnoticed. It also empowers others—within the contraints of the chosen OSS license—to validate the proposed model or algorithm with alternative implementations and compare it against the original implementation when discrepancies arise.

#### Shared knowledge pushes the field forward

OSS cultivates an ecosystem where researchers across institutions can freely collaborate, improving tools and methods in real time. Unlike proprietary software, which isolates progress within companies or specific labs, OSS allows researchers to build on each other's work without reinventing the wheel. This collaborative environment accelerates scientific discovery, as labs and researchers can focus on refining or extending existing algorithms, rather than duplicating efforts. In this way, OSS promotes the efficient use of resources, turning individual advancements into collective gains. Indeed the proteomics field has benefited from this is a number of ways: the ProteoWizard project is long-standing OSS resource in the proteomics community containing beloved tools like Skyline and msconvert. Numerous plugins have been developed for Skyline to accomplish specialized tasks in a fraction of the time it would have taken to develop the full solution from scratch. Likewise, msconvert has provided a unified interface to open mass spectrometry data formats, rather than requiring developers to wrangle proprietary formats and readers. Well-supported OSS provide a foundation that accelerates advancement of the field. 

Moreover, OSS democratizes access to high-quality tools, leveling the playing field for researchers in resource-limited settings. When foundational tools are open-source, scientists at smaller institutions or in countries with limited funding have access to the same technology as those in well-funded labs. This broad accessibility leads to a greater diversity of ideas and contributions, as scientists worldwide can implement, critique, and enhance these tools. OSS in science not only enhance rigor and speed, but enables a global community to push the boundaries of knowledge together.

#### The community can contribute to development

Open-source software also plays a critical role in iterative refinement. Bugs and mistakes are inevitable in complex software, and these issues are often best addressed through collaborative scrutiny. In our own work, users have encountered nuances to question and uncovered bugs that we subsequently corrected, improving the reliability and robustness of our tools. This feedback loop is unique to OSS, where the contributions from the community enhance the quality and precision of the software over time. Without such transparency, computational research can become a "black box" that stifles innovation rather than promoting it, hindering the growth and accuracy of scientific knowledge. OSS can foster a culture of shared accountability, where code is not just released but continuously scrutinized and refined, driving the field forward in a collective effort toward scientific rigor. We have indeed observed this in our own projects: At the time of writing, QuantMS and Mokapot now have 12 and 13 contributors, respectively. 

### Licenses in Proteomics Software

Before we delve into the role of OSS in computational proteomics, and before losing the reader in the details of the manuscript and the importance of FAIR software, we would like to highlight one of the fundamental aspects and challenges in the development of proteomics software: the use of software licenses.

Different to other fields in bioinformatics, proteomics software tools and algorithms are often using custom licenses, with complex clauses and terms that confuse the users and developers. These licenses often target commercialization, code reuse but also distribution and citation. In addition, as the field is evolving, and software becomes more complex and has multiple components, each component should have a different license and the dependencies between them should be clearly stated. 

For example, if a software tool that performs PTM-site localization is distributable, but the software that produces the PTMs, peptide identification inputs, etc is not, the user should be aware of this and the community, developers, and journal reviewers should be able to understand the challenge. It could be misunderstood that the software is open-source, when in reality, all the main components that it relies on are not. 

We recommend for the proteomics community as the gold standard for proteomics software development the following: 

- Use a standard OSS licenses like the Apache 2.0, MIT, GPL, LGPL, etc; a list of them can be found in (https://opensource.org/licenses). These licenses are well known, have been used in other fields, and are well understood by the community. These licenses are also compatible with the FAIR principles and the Open Source Initiative (OSI) guidelines and well-known by other fields in bioinformatics and computer science. In addition they all have a clear definition of what is allowed and what is not, and how the software can be distributed, reused, and cited.
- Clearly state the dependencies of the software, and the licenses of each of them. This will help the user to understand the software, the developers to know what they can use, and the journal reviewers to understand the software and its implications.

### Open Source in Proteomics

### Strategies to Commercialize OSS

As we previously mentioned, merely the fact that a piece of software is open-source does not necessarily mean that everyone can use it without financia. Indeed, OSS can be commercialized in a number of different ways depending on the owner's goals and principles. Here, we intend for commercialization to refer to any process by which OSS is monetized, regardless of whether it remains part of an academic lab, is developed by a company, or is spun-out into its own startup. In fact, we would argue that healthy OSS projects must be financially supported one or more of charitable means, grants, or commercialization, for the development of the project to be sustainable. Here, we discuss a few commercialization models that have become popular with OSS, which try to strike a balance between supporting openness and supporting future development. It is worth noting that these strategies are not necessarily mutually exclusive.

**Dual Licensing.** A popular commercialization option for OSS has been to offer the software under multiple licenses. Projects using this strategy are often available under a strong copyleft license (GPL, AGPL, etc.) with no financial cost. However, the copyleft nature of these licenses require any derivative works to published under a compatible open-source license, which is often undesirable for corporate users. Thus, these projects also offer more permissive licenses to paying customers, which allows the use of the OSS project within proprietary code. Although this strategy may seem easy to abuse, our experience has been that companies are often risk-averse and would rather purchase proper license rather than risk legal ramifications of violating a copyleft license. A successful example of this strategy outside of proteomics has been RStudio which is created by Posit. RStudio is currently available under an open-source AGPLv3 license, or under a commercial license when AGPLv3 is incompatible. Notably, developer should make sure to include a "contributor license agreement" as part of their requirements for new contributors to ensure their contributions can be distributed under both licenses.

**Support or Services.** Some OSS projects commercialize by offering support services or new feature development at a cost. Often users, particularly from corporate entities, are willing to pay for specialized training and ongoing support for their use of OSS projects.. In special instances, it may even be the case that outside entities are able to pay for the prioritization of specific features. This road must be tread carefully though; while there is benefit to allowing for sponsored features and they do benefit everyone once implemented, such a model risks losing control over the direction of an OSS project. Red Hat is the most prominent example of a company using this strategy to commercialize their enterprise Linux offering. 

**Software as a Service (SaaS).** The SaaS business model has become increasing popular in recent times. When using a SaaS model, the OSS project remains open-source, but commercialization occurs by building a platform around it. The platform then allows users to more easily use the OSS project. This model often includes a managed hardware or cloud infrastructure component, where users pay to merely interact with a web application to use the OSS tool, reducing the barrier to entry. In the bioinformatics space, NextFlow is an open-source bioinformatics workflow engine that has been commercialized by Seqera Labs using the SaaS model. Their current Seqera Platform product provides an interface to launch, observe, and explore workflow executions with NextFlow. 

**Open-Core.** The open-core commercialization model provides access to new features only to paying customers. Often this is not core functionality, but rather features such as a nicer user interface or early access to new features. Some variants of this model use a time delay for new features, where paying users have access to new features sooner than those using the fully OSS version. Practically, the implementation of this strategy often involves the create of private, upstream fork of the OSS code repository. New features are then added to the private fork and synced to the OSS version when ready. Such a strategy can also be used by academic labs to protect new features while being prepared for publication, although we would advocate for developing those in the open when possible. The open-core model is quite common and it proteomics it is used for ScaffoldDIA from Proteome Software: the open-source core of ScaffoldDIA is EncyclopeDIA.

### The Role of Closed-Source Software

Is proprietary, closed-source software ever appropriate in scientific research? We believe the answer to be yes—particularly when the software in question is not the subject of research. Indeed there is great commercial opportunity to build proprietary software from OSS. Although an OSS project may introduce a new algorithm or model to the scientific world, there is often many improvements that can be made to areas such as usability, scaling, and efficiency that can only be accomplished with commercial investment. Indeed, proprietary software can serve researchers well when they are most interested in using a tool answer biological questions, rather than seeking to understand or benchmark the underlying algorithm.

Perhaps more controversial is the idea of a company creating proprietary software that incorporates OSS that was created by an unaffiliated academic lab. Provided that the company is abiding by the terms of the OSS software license, this is a legitimate use of the original OSS software project. However, if this is problematic for an OSS project, we would recommend looking into the strong copyleft licenses and/or adopting a dual licensing strategy that we previously discussed. Regardless, it is important to remember that nearly all modern software build upon foundational OSS that we often take for granted.

### Concluding Remarks

As proteomics research increasingly relies upon computational tools, embracing open-source and FAIR principles is essential for ensuring transparency, reproducibility, and accessibility. We urge researchers, funding agencies, institutions, and companies to prioritize open-source and FAIR practices, especially in publicly funded work, to create a truly collaborative scientific ecosystem. By collectively advancing open-source software, the scientific community can build an inclusive, rigorous foundation that fosters innovation and extends the benefits of research to scientists and the public alike. As we venture into the future, we as a community should explore mechanisms to make OSS sustainable---for example, by creating a foundation for proteomics software to support OSS in our field. Regardless, let us come together commit to open science for a shared, sustainable future in proteomics and science at-large..
