### Title: Open source, and FAIR Research Software in Proteomics

Studies have shown that over 90% of scientists consider software critical to their research, with nearly 70% stating that their work would be infeasible without it [28751965]. Proteomics, like many areas of scientific and omics research, has become increasingly dependent on sophisticated and complex software algorithms and tools for data analysis and interpretation. Algorithms and software tools start from data generation and acquisition of mass spectrometers to data processing, analysis, and interpretation []. 

Computational proteomics, along with algorithm and software development, faces several key challenges common to other omics fields:

- The increasing complexity of data generated by mass spectrometers, the complex sequence of steps from spectral processing to statistical analysis, along with the need to manage algorithmic details and parameter settings, all contribute to making software development in proteomics a complex and demanding endeavor.
- Without structured development practices, proteomics software often struggles to maintain the quality, sustainability, and reproducibility necessary for reliable scientific research.
- Although most software tools are described in publications, the absence of open-source code, comprehensive documentation, and version control often impedes reproducibility and reuse. This lack of accessibility also limits opportunities for computer scientists and developers to contribute effectively to advancing proteomics software.

Open-source software (OSS) offers an answer to these challenges, empowering proteomics with tools that are not only accessible but also foster community-driven development, rigorous validation, and transparent sharing of methodologies [].

OSS has demonstrated clear benefits in increasing the accessibility, reusability, and visibility of scientific software. With code freely available for inspection, modification, and distribution, OSS encourages collaboration and creates avenues for continuous improvementâ€”factors that are critical in fields as data-intensive as proteomics. OSS is also aligned with the FAIR Guiding Principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) established for research data, which were expanded in 2022 to address the growing recognition of research software as a foundational research asset [].

In this viewpoint manuscript, we aim to explore the role of OSS in computational proteomics and its implications for the development of FAIR research software. We will discuss the benefits and challenges of OSS in proteomics, the role of OSS in the development of FAIR research software, and the importance of distribution, licensing, and citation of software in computational proteomics. We will also explore how other omics fields are dealing with OSS and FAIR software, and how these experiences can inform the development of proteomics software.
